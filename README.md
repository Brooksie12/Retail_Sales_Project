# Retail Sales Data Explorer

## Description:
A beginner-friendly Excel-based project exploring retail sales data using pivot tables, charts, and lookup functions.
Within this project I began to explore data visualisation in excel using graphs and pivot tables. I also began to utilise some of the other useful features in excel such as VLOOKUP and CONCATENATE.

## Background:
For my first Excel project I wanted to dive into the different capabilities and functions within excel, using some real world data and beginning to explore the data through this tool. 

## Features:
- Pivot tables for summarizing sales data
- Pivot charts with interactive filters
- Lookup functions (`VLOOKUP`)
- Text manipulation using `CONCATENATE`
- Basic exploratory data analysis

## Structure:
1 Excel file with 3 spreadsheets.
retail_sales_project.xlsx
- retail_sales_pivot_table: This sheet contains 2 pivot tables, 2 graphs and 3 filters to modify the graphs. 
- retail_sales_dataset: This is the dataset I used to generate the tables and graphs, alongside 2 practice tables begining to disect some of the data.
- Transactions: This is another exploratory sheet where I created a table pulling some data from the dataset alongside practicing using the vlookup and concatenate function.

## Usage/Setup
1. Download the Excel workbook
2. Open in:
   - Microsoft Excel (recommended), or
   - Google Sheets / Excel Online (features may vary)
